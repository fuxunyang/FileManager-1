# FileManager
FileManager in Window. Make by C#.
Nam KiHyun, End sophomore.  I needed my own file manager, 
so I decided to make it during winter vacation for studying.
Let's start The FileManager Project! - 2017/02/12 --- Complete - 2017/02/25

#1 Add the categories you need.

  You can add the categories you need by pressing the blue button.
  
  If you added a category, then you can change a name by right click.

  Also, you can delete the category by right click.
  
#2 Let's put a folder for a specific category.

  Perhaps you want to have gather folders related to a specific situation.
  
  First, click the category. Then you can see a sub form for that the category.
  
  Second, add folders associated with that category with the add button. Keep in mind that you should not put folders that are too deep in depth. Memory efficiency is poor due to unnecessary work.
  
  Also, you can delete the folders with delete button.
 
#3 Exit the Program.
  
  If you want to exit the File Maneger, then you just click Exit Button in Right Click.
  
  When the Program exit, your setup data is automatically saved. The data is saved in Data Folder.
  
#4 The data folder must be in the same path as the File Manager program!!!!!!!!!!!!
